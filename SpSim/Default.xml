	<!-- Defines the place the game takes place. Most things in this game have an <id>, which is then used
		to reference it elsewhere. <name> is the room's name and <description> is the room's description. Easy no?
		
		Since this is a game where we want to find reasons to spank girls, I'll need to add something to 
		dynamically changes a room description later, showing as it gets more or less messy. But since in theory 
		different girls can produce different kinds of mess, and since things can can always get messier, 
		I'm totally not touching that until I have a clearer idea of how to implement it. For now, the descriptions 
		are static and assume that your house is in a permanent mess. You're welcome.
		
		sitplace, lieplace and bendplace are the used during the positioning for a spanking. So an otk spanking 
		on the living room has the protagonist sitting on the sofa, for example. <links> define how the place is 
		connected. The numbers refer to the <id> of other rooms. If you link room 1 to room 2, remember to link 
		room 2 to room 1 too, or you'll create an one way passage!
		%G1 is changed to "<name> of the Girl with <id> 1", so during game it appears like Miyu's room.

		<name> is how the protagonist calls him or herself. It has two special values:

			anything else, the game will use a third person narrative. You'll then be the responsible

		<gender> will define how the possessive looks like when you're on the third person.
		
		<textcolor> is the the #RGB color for messages said by the protagonist. Since the protagonist is also

		<textcolor> is the the #RGB color for messages said by this girl. Maybe this can allow the text
		to become more readable. If you don't like colors, set everything to #000000.
		
		<description> allows you to look at the girls and has no more uses for now. 
		
		<lore> is what you know about the girl. In the future, this field will be expanded to show the reasons 
		you have to spank the girl in game. But right now, I just wrote something that should make you want to 
		spank them right away.
		
		<resistance> show how much of a hardass each girl is, literally.

		<affection> is how much the girl likes you
			0 : hate
			1 : dislike
			2 : neutral
			3 : like
			4 : love
			This should serve to more interesting things later, but right now it serves to determine how contrite
				the girl is at the spanking's start. girls that hate or dislike you start the spanking defiant
				neutral girls start it unsure, and girls that like or love you start it repentful. The repent
				values, by their turn, serve to filter messages during the spankings.

		<spankable> true or false, defines if you can spank a girl. A request, it allows you to mod somebody 
		who'll only watch now. If a girl has spankable false you can't spank or even hold her. To do a watcher,
		mod in a girl with <spankable>false and add custom messages to her that reflect that she's not afraid.
		
		<register_activity> allows you to set the things each girl does. in a future release, you'll add attributes
			to this to determine for example the time when each girl goes to sleep or that she REALLY LIKES
			doing a particular thing, but right now each girl just picks a possible registered activity at random.
			
		<own_room> is the room each girl calls her own. Nothing is keeping you from housing more than one person
			per room. Used with activities.
			
		We're doing away with roompref now. Activities will determine where every girl is likely to be found.
		
		Choosing the clothes for a girl involve the nodes <clothpref>, <undpref>, <sockpref> and <footpref>.
		sockpref and footpref can have an item with id=0, which represents the chances of the girl deciding
		to not wear that part. Haruko is always barefoot when she's at home, for instance.
		
		The ch attribute on each item node represents a (10 x ch)% chance that the girl will pick that item. 
		If the ch attribute for all items add up to 10 or more, the girl won't ever pick an item outside that 
		list (and normalizing that list is up to you). For example, when dressing up, Miyu picks a dress 80% 
		of the time, and a sweater/skirt combo on the other 20. The logic for this is that a dress is a "complete" 
		clothing (covers = 3), but a sweater and a skirt require another piece to be worn to cover bottom and top, 
		respectively. The game doesn't support girls walking around naked, top or bottomless. Naked sweaters 
		are supported if you create a sweater that is a complete clothing.
				
		When the ch attribute sum is less than 10, the girl has some chance to pick any item. For example,
		other than one particular item, Shino wears completely random clothes all the time.
		
		Finally, each girl can have her own messages, giving them a small measure of personality. Read the 
		heading before <messages> to understand how messages work and then come back here. If a girl has 
		custom messages for a situation, the game will always try to use them before falling back to the 
		generic message list. I only added a couple of messages to Miyu to show how it's done.

			<description>Miyu has reddish-brown eyes and long black hair, 
			going down to her waist, in a somewhat stylish hime cut. She's 
			the shortest student of her class and is very conscious of her 
			(non-existent) cup size. Miyu gets angry easily and her neutral 
			state is one that most people would call "annoyed".</description>
			
			<lore>I met Miyu about six months ago, when I saved her life. 
			She claims to be the daughter of a powerful and shady business rival 
			to my family, who had to disappear for a time. While her story's main 
			details match (her "dad" exists and actually disappeared, she's registered 
			with the correct family name, etc.), there remains the fact that it was 
			widely known that that family didn't have heirs, as everybody I
			consulted about Miyu could confirm. Nobody in the business remembers seeing
			or hearing about Miyu before and nobody wanted to take care of her. What I 
			know for sure is that she will certainly die if I kick her out of this 
			house (I actually did that two days after meeting her, and had to save 
			her life again, like, 15 minutes later). Miyu is nasty and arrogant and acts 
			as if she never had to help with housekeeping before. Her expensive tastes 
			are entirely at odds with her complete lack of funds (but amazingly, all 
			her school expenses are already paid for until she graduates). Since I 
			don't have the heart to boot her, I decided to start teaching her better 
			manners.</lore>

		Other than <id>, <name> and <description> that should be kind of boring by now,

		So the game right now produces "she's wearing shorts" and "she's wearing a skirt".
		<resistance> is how much wearing that clothing helps to absorb the strength of a spanking. It should
			be 1 for light pieces (mostly everything), 2 for thick clothing, like denim.
		<covers> is 1 for the top (shirts, tank-tops, sweaters), 
					2 for the bottom (pants, shorts, skirts),
					3 for one-pieces, like dresses, school swimsuits and such,

					5 for socks
					6 for footwear
		Right now, a girl will use a single piece of clothing with <covers> 3, or a set with a piece that covers 1 
		and another that covers 2. <und> defines how that piece of clothing is removed, which is important when 
		the undressing part comes. The possible values right now are 
			<up> ("I pull her skirt up."), 
			<down> ("I pull her shorts down.") and
			<off> ("I take her tie-up panties off")
		
		Finally, the game mostly uses <description> when you're looking to a clothing, and <name> when that piece 
		is mentioned as part of an action. So it's "Haruko is wearing denim cuttoff shorts.", 
		"You lower Haruko's shorts, exposing her strawberry print panties." and "You lower Haruko's panties, 
		exposing her bare bottom."

	<!-- an <activity> defines what people can do in this sim, other than being spanked. <id>'s use is obvious.
	
		When a character decides to do an activity, first they need to check where they will do that. The first
		step for this is to check if the activity has one or more <require_room_fixture> nodes.
		
		each <require_room_fixture> node has to be fullfilled. When you write <requires_room_fixture>A,B
		the game understands that the character needs a room with A or B. For an activity that requires 
		A AND B, write two <require_room_fixture> nodes.
		
		If there's at least one room where the activity is possible, the character then checks if a 
		<prefers_own_room /> node exists and if their own room is among the possible ones. If it is, it'll
		be selected in preference to any other. If not, the choosen room will be picked at random among all
		the possibilities.
		
		<lasts>is how much time, in game turns, the character will spend doing that activity, written as
		minimum time-maximum time. The game will pick a number between these.
		
		The <position> node determines how people need to be to do that activity. As with room fixtures,
		writing something like <position>lie,stand means the character will pick a position at random from these. 
		
		<name> is how people in the world talk about the activity. <during> is how they look while doing it.
		When a character starts doing something, the generic message is: 
			CHARACTER NAME [sits down/lies down] and starts to <name>.
		For some activities, this looks strange, so you can add a <starts> node. With a <starts> node, the message
		becomes CHARACTER NAME [sits down/lies down] and <starts>. The analogous situation happens when the character
		finishes the activity: The generic message for that is:
			CHARACTER NAME stops <during> [and stands up].
			
		Once a character finishes an activity, it'll immediately find something else to do.
		
		Finally, use <sets_alertness_to> to make people distracted or asleep depending on the activity.
		
		For actions that the progagonist can also do, the logic is somewhat different. Whenever you're on the 
		room you'd pick to do an activity, you'll have the chance to start it. Once you start it, you'll become
		distracted/asleep as determined by the activity and time will pass. The idea is that if something happens
		to interrupt you, you'll become alert and resume acting right away, but right now there's nothing to do 
		that, so you'll end doing the activity at the determined time.

	<!-- Here we define how people talk to each other. -->
	<dialogues>
	</dialogues>
	
	<!-- Here we define most of the game's text. <holding> serves to take girls by the hand or ear and drag 
		them by the house. You have three chances to guess for what <spanking> is used. <implement> is how
		they react when you pick up something nasty. <status> describe how do they look, besides appearance 
		(use this to show that a girl in pain is crying, etc) and other details.
		
		The important thing to take note here is that the game will randomly pick a message from all
		the ones with the same tag when that kind of message is called. So if the game is narrating a spanking,
		it'll pick a random <spanking><during> message. You can limit when a message appears by adding the 
		attribute reqpos, which requires that the spanking is happening in one of the forms listed, or 
		reqund, which requires one (or more) forms of undress. Likewise, you can use reqby on a <holding> tag,
		to require that the girl is being held by the ear or hand.
		
		If the game can't find an useable message when it calls for one, it'll print a "...", so take care to 
		not be too restrictive with your req attributes.
		
		The main spanking part can last for up to 12 steps now. It uses 4 message filters: reqpos and reqund, 
		which we already explained, plus two new ones:
		reqpain, that filters in how much pain the girl is, on the following scale:
			0: no pain
			1: a bit of pain
			2: some pain
			3: enough pain
			4: a lot of pain
			5: overwhelming pain. Let's no go there.
		and reqrepnt, that filters how much the girl agree that she should be spanked, on the following scale:
			0: girl is defiant
			1: girl is unsure
			2: girl is repentful
		
		Because the <during> stage repeats itself up to 12 times, the game keeps a list of used messages and
		tries to not repeat them, inside a single spanking. Be sure to have enough variety of messages.
				
		Finally, see that the messages are listed in a logical order. Don't add the reqpos attribute to messages
		before <spanking><position>, because the game will hang up (it doesn't know what position you'll use it 
		yet). Likewise, don't add reqund before <spanking><reactundress> and reqby before <holding><start>.
		reqrepnt only makes sense from <spanking><announce> onwards. reqpain can be used whenever you want, though.
		The idea is that all girls start at pain 0, and stay at the pain level you left them after the spanking.
		This will slowly heal back to 0 so you should totally be able to have a girl that was already spanked 
		have a <holding><reactannounce reqpain="1,2,3,4,5"> like "W-wait, you already spanked me!" message.
		 -->

		<status>
			<!-- call is how the girls refer to the protagonist. Unlike typical messages, call serves
				to be inserted on other messages. In correct English, this should usually be just "you". Even
				"Sir" or "Ma'am" will look unnatural on a lot of cases. But since we're doing an anime based
				sim, we need to have girls calling you onii-chan, Shinji-kun or Sempai. If call is 
				different from "you", the game assumes the call uses third person syntax, so %Prsptb in
				"%Prsptb hurting me..." becomes "Onii-chan is hurting me..." instead of "You're hurting me..." 
				YOU'RE WELCOME. 
				
				Additionally, if you have girls calling you something other than "you", you can add %OCB Before
				the start of her lines or %OCA After them. This becomes an "Optional Call." Say you have a girl 
				that calls you "Shinji-kun": Then "%OCBI-I was a bad girl..." becomes 
				"Shinji-kun, I-I was a bad girl..."
				while another girl that calls you "you" will say just "I-I was a bad girl..." on the same message.
				
				Likewise, "Please, forgive me%OCA." becomes "Please, forgive me, Shinji-kun." for the first girl 
				and "Please, forgive me." for people who call you "you". -->
