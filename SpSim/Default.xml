	<!-- Defines the place the game takes place. Most things in this game have an <id>, which is then used
		to reference it elsewhere. <name> is the room's name and <description> is the room's description. Easy no?
		
		Since this is a game where we want to find reasons to spank girls, I'll need to add something to 
		dynamically changes a room description later, showing as it gets more or less messy. But since in theory 
		different girls can produce different kinds of mess, and since things can can always get messier, 
		I'm totally not touching that until I have a clearer idea of how to implement it. For now, the descriptions 
		are static and assume that your house is in a permanent mess. You're welcome.
		
		sitplace, lieplace and bendplace are the used during the positioning for a spanking. So an otk spanking 
		on the living room has the protagonist sitting on the sofa, for example. <links> define how the place is 
		connected. The numbers refer to the <id> of other rooms. If you link room 1 to room 2, remember to link 
		room 2 to room 1 too, or you'll create an one way passage!
    
    If you add <scatteredClothes> to a room, you mark it to contain some clothes around. max sets how many clothes
    will be maximal in this Room
    You can also define what type (written in the clothes section) of clothes is scattert.
    e.g.
    <scatteredClothes max="4">all</scatteredClothes> puts 0-4 random clothes in this room.
    <scatteredClothes>6</scatteredClothes> puts some socks in this room.
    <scatteredClothes max="3">4,5</scatteredClothes> puts 0-3 pieces of underwear (bras and/or panties) in this room
    
    Finally <dumpclothes /> marks the room as clothing dump, all unused clothes will be dumped in the dump
    with the smallest Id, after the girls are dressed up and the other clothes have been scattered. This tagg
    is totally optional.

	<!-- Define who's giving the spankings in this game.
		<name> is how the protagonist calls him or herself. It has two special values:
			"I" will set the game on a first person narrative. This is the default mode.
			"you" will set the game on a second person narrative.
			anything else, the game will use a third person narrative. You'll then be the responsible
				for adjusting all the messages to avoid hulk-speech: "Shiji go to kitchen." 

		<gender> will define how the possessive looks like when you're on the third person.
		
		<textcolor> is the the #RGB color for messages said by the protagonist. Since the protagonist is also
		the narrator, choose a nice neutral color here. #000000 works well.
		
		Thanks to the possibility of the protagonist having a room and the certainty of having a hand,
		you can use %Isp and %Rsp when a girl is referring to a Room or Implement.
		
		<startingroom> is the room <id> where the game starts.

		I'm a high school senior year now and have managed to turn my house 
		into a perfect, calm place to study. But then, through a ridiculous series 
		of circumstances, I ended up having to house three girls with me. They're 
		not the best girls. Wait, never mind that - they're terrible girls, 
		each one in her own special way. Now my house is a mess and my dreams

	<!-- Define who's receiving the spankings. <id> and <name> are just what you think they are.
	
		<textcolor> is the the #RGB color for messages said by this girl. Maybe this can allow the text
		to become more readable. If you don't like colors, set everything to #000000.
		
		<description> allows you to look at the girls and has no more uses for now. 
		
		<lore> is what you know about the girl. In the future, this field will be expanded to show the reasons 
		you have to spank the girl in game. But right now, I just wrote something that should make you want to 
		spank them right away.
		
		<resistance> show how much of a hardass each girl is, literally.

		<affection> is how much the girl likes you
			0 : hate
			1 : dislike
			2 : neutral
			3 : like
			4 : love
			This should serve to more interesting things later, but right now it serves to determine how contrite
				the girl is at the spanking's start. girls that hate or dislike you start the spanking defiant
				neutral girls start it unsure, and girls that like or love you start it repentful. The repent
				values, by their turn, serve to filter messages during the spankings.

		<spankable> true or false, defines if you can spank a girl. A request, it allows you to mod somebody 
		who'll only watch now. If a girl has spankable false you can't spank or even hold her. To do a watcher,
		mod in a girl with <spankable>false and add custom messages to her that reflect that she's not afraid.
		
		<register_activity> allows you to set the things each girl does. in a future release, you'll add attributes
			to this to determine for example the time when each girl goes to sleep or that she REALLY LIKES
			doing a particular thing, but right now each girl just picks a possible registered activity at random.
			
		<own_room> is the room each girl calls her own. Nothing is keeping you from housing more than one person
			per room. Used with activities.
		
		Choosing the clothes for a girl involve the nodes <topcloth>, <botcloth>, <onecloth>, <bracloth>,
    <undcloth>, <soccloth> & <shocloth> wrapped by <clothpref>. The xxxcloth nodes contain two attributes
    sepperated by ",". The first one is the clothings's Id, the second one the chance to pick this clothing.
    When choosing a clothing for a part, the chances are summed up (max. total should be 10) and filled up
    with a random element (when the sum < 10). When choosing between an onepiece or a top-bottom combo
    the chances of the onepieces and tops are added up (to max. 20) and one of them will be selected.
    If that Item is a top, the programm will select a bootm piece too.
    All the xxxcloth-Taggs need the fitting girl-Id. This seems to be useless, but due to C#'s
    global Xml-Scanning this is needed to decide which pref belongs to which girl. I'll sees if I can do
    anything about that.
		You can add an element with id 0 to every note to add a chance to make this part naked. Naked girls
    will be supported now ;)
		
    Currently not Supported:
    
		Finally, each girl can have her own messages, giving them a small measure of personality. Read the 
		heading before <messages> to understand how messages work and then come back here. If a girl has 
		custom messages for a situation, the game will always try to use them before falling back to the 
		generic message list. I only added a couple of messages to Miyu to show how it's done.

			<description>Miyu has reddish-brown eyes and long black hair, 
			going down to her waist, in a somewhat stylish hime cut. She's 
			the shortest student of her class and is very conscious of her 
			(non-existent) cup size. Miyu gets angry easily and her neutral 
			state is one that most people would call "annoyed".</description>
			
			<lore>I met Miyu about six months ago, when I saved her life. 
			She claims to be the daughter of a powerful and shady business rival 
			to my family, who had to disappear for a time. While her story's main 
			details match (her "dad" exists and actually disappeared, she's registered 
			with the correct family name, etc.), there remains the fact that it was 
			widely known that that family didn't have heirs, as everybody I
			consulted about Miyu could confirm. Nobody in the business remembers seeing
			or hearing about Miyu before and nobody wanted to take care of her. What I 
			know for sure is that she will certainly die if I kick her out of this 
			house (I actually did that two days after meeting her, and had to save 
			her life again, like, 15 minutes later). Miyu is nasty and arrogant and acts 
			as if she never had to help with housekeeping before. Her expensive tastes 
			are entirely at odds with her complete lack of funds (but amazingly, all 
			her school expenses are already paid for until she graduates). Since I 
			don't have the heart to boot her, I decided to start teaching her better 
			manners.</lore>

	<!-- Define how the girls will be dressed before you inevitably undress them for the spankings.
		Other than <id>, <name> and <description> that should be kind of boring by now, 
		<reqart> says if when describing this piece of clothing we should use an indefinite article or not. 
		So the game right now produces "she's wearing shorts" and "she's wearing a skirt".
		<resistance> is how much wearing that clothing helps to absorb the strength of a spanking. It should
			be 1 for light pieces (mostly everything), 2 for thick clothing, like denim. This is only important
			for clothes, that cover the girl's bottom (type 2,3,5) and can be ignored (left out, default will be 1) for the other parts.
		<type> determines what kind of clothing this is
					1 for the top (shirts, tank-tops, sweaters), 
					2 for the bottom (pants, shorts, skirts),
					3 for one-pieces, like dresses, school swimsuits and such,
					4 for the bra
					5 for underwear
					6 for socks
					7 for footwear
		Right now, a girl will use a single piece of clothing with <type> 3, or a set with a piece that covers 1 
		and another that covers 2. <und> defines how that piece of clothing is removed, which is important when 
		the undressing part comes. The possible values right now are 
			<up> ("I pull her skirt up."), 
			<down> ("I pull her shorts down.") and
			<off> ("I take her tie-up panties off")
		
		Finally, the game mostly uses <description> when you're looking to a clothing, and <name> when that piece 
		is mentioned as part of an action. So it's "Haruko is wearing denim cuttoff shorts.", 
		"You lower Haruko's shorts, exposing her strawberry print panties." and "You lower Haruko's panties, 
		exposing her bare bottom."
		
		If you want to have several copies of one Clothing (like maid dresses for everyone or one panty per day per person ),
		just do the old Ctrl+C-Ctrl+V-thingy as often as you wish. Just remember to change the Id to make it unique.

	<!-- Here we define most of the game's text. <holding> serves to take girls by the hand or ear and drag 
		them by the house. You have three chances to guess for what <spanking> is used. <implement> is how
		they react when you pick up something nasty. <status> describe how do they look, besides appearance 
		(use this to show that a girl in pain is crying, etc) and other details.
		
		The important thing to take note here is that the game will randomly pick a message from all
		the ones with the same tag when that kind of message is called. So if the game is narrating a spanking,
		it'll pick a random <spanking><during> message. You can limit when a message appears by adding the 
		attribute reqpos, which requires that the spanking is happening in one of the forms listed, or 
		reqund, which requires one (or more) forms of undress. Likewise, you can use reqby on a <holding> tag,
		to require that the girl is being held by the ear or hand.
		
		If the game can't find an useable message when it calls for one, it'll print a special message
    (you'll know it, when it happens), so take care to not be too restrictive with your req attributes.
		
		The main spanking part can last for up to 12 steps now. It uses 4 message filters: reqpos and reqund, 
		which we already explained, plus two new ones:
		reqpain, that filters in how much pain the girl is, on the following scale:
			0: no pain
			1: a bit of pain
			2: some pain
			3: enough pain
			4: a lot of pain
			5: overwhelming pain. Let's no go there.
		and reqrepnt, that filters how much the girl agree that she should be spanked, on the following scale:
			0: girl is defiant
			1: girl is unsure
			2: girl is repentful
		
		The <during> stage repeats itself up to 12 times. Be sure to have enough variety of messages.
				
		The idea is that all girls start at pain 0, and stay at the pain level you left them after the spanking.
		This will slowly heal back to 0 so you should totally be able to have a girl that was already spanked 
		have a <holding><reactannounce reqpain="1,2,3,4,5"> like "W-wait, you already spanked me!" message.

	<messages>

			<!-- call is how the girls refer to the protagonist. Unlike typical messages, call serves
				to be inserted on other messages. In correct English, this should usually be just "you". Even
				"Sir" or "Ma'am" will look unnatural on a lot of cases. But since we're doing an anime based
				sim, we need to have girls calling you onii-chan, Shinji-kun or Sempai. If call is 
				different from "you", the game assumes the call uses third person syntax, so %Prsptb in
				"%Prsptb hurting me..." becomes "Onii-chan is hurting me..." instead of "You're hurting me..." 
				YOU'RE WELCOME. 
				
				Additionally, if you have girls calling you something other than "you", you can add %OCB Before
				the start of her lines or %OCA After them. This becomes an "Optional Call." Say you have a girl 
				that calls you "Shinji-kun": Then "%OCBI-I was a bad girl..." becomes 
				"Shinji-kun, I-I was a bad girl..."
				while another girl that calls you "you" will say just "I-I was a bad girl..." on the same message.
				
				Likewise, "Please, forgive me%OCA." becomes "Please, forgive me, Shinji-kun." for the first girl 
				and "Please, forgive me." for people who call you "you". -->
