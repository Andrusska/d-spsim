<!-- call is how the girls refer to the protagonist. Unlike typical messages, call serves

to be inserted on other messages. In correct English, this should usually be just "you". Even

"Sir" or "Ma'am" will look unnatural on a lot of cases. But since we're doing an anime based

sim, we need to have girls calling you onii-chan, Shinji-kun or Sempai. If call is

different from "you", the game assumes the call uses third person syntax, so %Prsptb in

"%Prsptb hurting me..." becomes "Onii-chan is hurting me..." instead of "You're hurting me..."

YOU'RE WELCOME.

Additionally, if you have girls calling you something other than "you", you can add %OCB Before

the start of her lines or %OCA After them. This becomes an "Optional Call." Say you have a girl

that calls you "Shinji-kun": Then "%OCBI-I was a bad girl..." becomes

"Shinji-kun, I-I was a bad girl..."

while another girl that calls you "you" will say just "I-I was a bad girl..." on the same message.

Likewise, "Please, forgive me%OCA." becomes "Please, forgive me, Shinji-kun." for the first girl

and "Please, forgive me." for people who call you "you". -->

<call>you</call>

<!-- <call>Mr. Rogers</call> WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?! D: -->
